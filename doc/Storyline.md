- Episode 1 - The Cave：
Main character(X) is having a dream in which he/she fell down a hole, woke up and found himself in a cave. It’s dark. X’s heart rate increases and until he finds a torch and lights it up [sanity]. Then, X sees a stone and picks it up. X is scared so he imagines it to be a companion that talks to and helps him. X: ”I’ll call you Pebble.” Pebble comes to life and follows X around.  

- Episode 2 - Pebble & the Darkness：
Pebble tells X that it is a small stone which was bullied by other bigger ones. They are in a world ruled by stones which absorb light. Since light sources are limited and slow to regenerate, the world will become dark sometimes. X has to find light in order to survive.

- Episode 3 - Stone Monsters & Weapons：
No one is allowed to leave this world. There are stone monsters guarding paths/doors. However, Pebble had had enough and was trying to find a way out when it met X but it was too weak to fight against others. X and Pebble plan to escape the underworld together. X starts to collect materials for weapons (e.g. wood, iron, brass...) to defeat the stones.

- Episode 4 - Sanity：
As X walks around, he/she finds that the environment is strange and can change when he/she gets to certain places (e.g. desert, grassland, river..., layers of dream?). The weather is unpredictable, sunny for now and yet it rains hard later. The days and nights can rotate at a random speed. This is different from the world X is used to so he constantly feels unsettled. During the night, it gets dark and X starts to panic. Pebble talks more to X (all imagination to comfort X) and being less/more helpful. The visibility is limited to a small circle around X so he/she needs to find torch or light again to calm himself/herself or else the sanity will continue to drop [heart rate becomes faster, the environment gets blurry, X moves slower?]. The sanity may also drop due to more enemies and X’s mood or progress [time constraint]. 

- Episode 5 - The Final Battle：
X sees a light spot far away, believes it’s the exit and walks towards it. As X and Pebble approach the exit, more and more stones appear and start to accumulate in front of them and turn into a massive monster that completely blocks the exit. After a fight, the monster breaks into pieces and disappears, a large amount of light goes in via the exit, the world is lightened up.

- Episode 6 - The End：
In the end, X escapes the underworld, wakes up and sees “Pebble” on his bed (lifeless). The darkness ends and the sun shines through the window. “What an experience”.
