## Welcome to Into the Dark

You’re awoken by the echoes of crumbling rocks and dripping water. As your vision adjusts to the dim lighting your eyes trace the outline of a large underground cave with seemingly unexplored caverns scattered into the distance. The path directly in front of you is blocked by large immovable boulders, and while you have no memory of how you’ve ended up in this place you’re well aware you need to leave as soon as possible. Fortunately, your mission won’t need to be completed alone, a newfound mineral-based friend has been waiting by your side for you to emerge from your slumber. Pebble, your assistant is here to offer advice on how to navigate this foreign environment. He’s seen travellers become lost in this labyrinth before and knows humans can only stay in this area for a limited amount of time before their sanity fully debleats. Pebble is aware of the traps and pitfalls you will encounter while working your way through the cave and will provide guidance as you make your attempt to escape. Pebble has been cast aside by his rock community for being too small and now dedicates his time to help rescue humans from the rock lair as an act of defiance.

## Timer:

Be mindful of your remaining time! Once you start a new game the timer will immediately begin counting down. The colour of the timer will fade from green to red as your elapsed time increases. In addition, the zoom on the camera will increase as time elapses and your sanity decreases. This will lower your field of view and make it harder to navigate the terrain.
