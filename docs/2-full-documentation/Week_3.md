# **Week 3: 30th October - 5th November**

## **Process**

### Weekly Overview
As UML class diagram was developed last week, game development followed the order and relationship between different classes, which made the the process more structured. Moreover, team members experimented with the coding platform and created a character (a block) that can move. For this week, the team continued to use Miro board to create a MVC model based on the different classes generated in the UML diagram which further defines how the three main components of the game interact with each other: controller, map and elements. The sprint tasks were done according to the model: a map was created, players can see their input as they control the character. Camera view was implemented that always had the character in the centre of the screen as it moved around. 

Lessons learned: The class diagram needs to be based on use cases. Internal user stories need to be created when developing game features so that user requirements will be fulfilled and the whole process should be documented for future reference. Moreover, it may be better to set a small rather than a hard-to-reach goal since each sprint is only one week long. It is also helpful to move the tasks which had been done on GitHub in time so that the sprint progress is up-to-date. The team may function better when taking course load into consideration while assigning tasks so that distribution of the development tasks can be more reasonable and effective. 

The presentation created for the customer meeting on the 6th November is linked here, which will have GIFs for some of the artefacts in this weeks documentation:  [Presentation](https://github.bath.ac.uk/Team-Cyan/Dungeon/blob/develop/doc/week3-presentation/presentation3.md)

### Meeting Minutes

**Customer meeting debrief and sprint planning:**\
Attendance: He Jiang, Julius Martinez, Lewis Williams, Samuel Love, Tianyu Ji, Tom Wells, Vlad Postmangiu Luchian, Yandong Guo 

A sprint planning meeting was held right after the customer meeting, in which the team added tasks to sprint backlog according to the user requirements and additional features that could be added to the game. These informal discussions of features were later turned into the use case as shown in this weeks documentation. The customer expressed a preference toward a high-resolution art style for the game so a task to find sprites that would fit the style was created and assigned. The customer also wanted to see a variety of backgrounds and scenes while playing the game. Therefore, map generation was added to this week's sprint tasks. In addition to the customer's suggestions, the team also decided to work on menu screens since they are a fundamental part of a game. Another component of a game is sounds so some member were assigned to find background music and short sound effects that fit with the game theme. In terms of character movement, since a map will be generated which will influence where the character can go, gravity and collision are needed to make the movements seem more real (e.g. the character jumps down - gravity; cannot pass the edge of the map - collision). \

**MVC model - Controller, Map and Elements:**\
Attendance: He Jiang, Julius Martinez, Lewis Williams, Samuel Love, Tianyu Ji, Tom Wells, Vlad Postmangiu Luchian, Yandong Guo \
MVC:

- User uses controller->Controller manipulates model->Model updates view->View sees user
  - Need a model class- the map of all the elements
  - View is the camera - main view takes input and send to controller
  - Controller is all of the characters and elements/methods of the elements
Move:
- View reads position from model
- Player in the model gives player position to the main view->Render(): A key press in main view->sends to controller which interprets the key and then change player position in the model
Map:
- Random map generator
- Menu->seed->generate map
- Every bit of the map has coordinate, get type of environment from coordinate
   - Map has get element at position function, returns game element
  - Destroy-return void
  - Getplayer(): return position
  - private: horizontal & vertical size, seed; have setters & getters
Elements
- Elements relative to the player position
- Elements in environment can become items that can be picked up (update map), interact with player
- Call items in the range of the player
- Every element is on the map, view just takes info from the map
- Action 1 hit-> takes element from the environment and reduces the health

Questions:
- Main view has to be re-rendered when the player gets to the edge of the screen - controller or model?
- Each class has a method called view?
- How to implement main map controller?  



**Sprint review and presentation creation**:
Attendance: He Jiang, Julius Martinez, Lewis Williams, Samuel Love, Tianyu Ji, Tom Wells, Vlad Postmangiu Luchian, Yandong Guo \

- A map could be generated that had a black background with edges, different obstacles and materials.

We were not able to achieve the gravity this week and the collision was still not properly implemented, so would both need work in the next sprint week. One problem which meant we did not achieve what we wanted was the coursework deadlines happening at the same time. This is further discussed in the exception handling section.

### Exception Handling
Many members had course deadlines this week so the team had to balance between keeping up with the progress of game development and finishing individual coursework. Sprint planning meeting was delayed until after a deadline that several members had for their coursework. Heading forward to the final week with multiple deadlines, we will have to think what is achievable by each member.

## **product contents**

### Customer interview

The customer suggested having a way to interact with the game by controlling the character so that the main character needs to be able to move according to userâ€™s input. After the team presented a general idea of the background story and some possible features for the game, the customer expressed an interest in the sanity level feature again (same as the last customer meeting). After looking at several proposed art styles for the game, the customer had indicated that the one with higher resolution could show better layers of the ground and material types. Related to that, the customer also wanted to play in different backgrounds so a wider variety of scenes need to be constructed with relatively high resolution.

### Software design Documentation
MVC model was added based on the UML diagram to get a more specific relationship between controller, map and elements. No changes had been made to UML since last week.

### User interface design

As the game becomes more complicated we decided it would be better to display the interface design in sections than one chronological table. 

**Character:**

- Once in the game there will be character that can move and interact with the whole map [1]

**Menu:**  

- There will be a starting menu screen with the game settings, load game, continue and new game [2]
- In the settings tab there will be choices for audio, visuals, and controls [1]
- The player can go to an in game menu with save game and achievements [1]

**Sounds:**

- There should be background music played at the menu screen and during the game. Background music can change along with the characterâ€™s state such as sanity levels and become more intense during events like a boss fight [1]
- Sounds should be triggered when certain actions are performed (e.g. menu click, fight, mining) [1]

Inventory:
- The player can access an inventory screen which has options for equipment [1]
- In the equipment tab there will be options for view, craft, and delete [1]

**Game flow:**

- When the player had successfully completed the game they will be sent to the credits and the starting screen [2]
